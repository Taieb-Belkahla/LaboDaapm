In overall, for someone not too sharp with android app development, both projects/ exercices were quiet a challenge and took me a while to fulfill what was tasked.
Knowing that the layout/ UI can be well developped and better presented by myself.
For the second project, there were some debugging to be done; from what i noticed there are several possibilities to pass types/ images either by including them in an arraylist or by calling them separetly.
